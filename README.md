# Towards adaptivity via a new discrepancy principle for Poisson inverse problems

Simulation code accompanying the article G.Mika, Z.Szkutnik, "Towards adaptivity via a new discrepancy principle for Poisson inverse problems".

To replicate the results do:
1. navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned
2. run `chmod +x run.sh`
3. execute the bash script `./run.sh`
4. the results will be available (by default) in location `/var/lib/docker/volumes/output/_data`

Docker image is available under this [link](https://hub.docker.com/r/grzegorzmika/morozov-in-poisson-problems).
